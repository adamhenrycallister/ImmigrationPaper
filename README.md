Analysis for the paper "Immigration, Deportation, and Discrimination: Hispanic Political Opinion Since the Election of Donald Trump" in the _Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences_ ([link](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0739986319840717)). In this paper, we look at how the following factors affect Latino opinion on deportation:
 - language preference (English vs. Spanish)
 - knowing an undocumented immigrant
 - age
 - gender
 - time lived in the United States
Overall, we find that language preference and knowing an undocumented immigrant have the greatest effect on 1) suvey participants' attitudes toward deportation practices and 2) the likelihood that a given survey participant has perceived an increase in discrimination toward Latinos since the election of Donald Trump.
